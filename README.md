# companion

This repository is my version of the of the Blue Robotics version of the 
[ArduPilot/companion](https://github.com/ArduPilot/companion) repository.

Eventually this will contain all changes necessary for the Sea Searcher project; however, for now it just contains small changes to ensure that it actually updates the rover.
